# Call2Action
This code listens to your audio levels. When audio levels exceed a certain threshold determined by the user it triggers an action.
Currently the action is set up to type any mmessage given in the input.
It also displays a live graph of your volume level to make setting a volume level for your situation easier and allow for easier debugging.
